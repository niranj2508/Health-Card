# Health-Card

We have aadhar card, Pan card, Voter id, Driving licence and so many identity proofs for our day to day
transactions, but there's a major missing in the health sector.So healthcard is mandatory
which manages our day to day health history like disease, allergy etc. And same card is used everywhere 
in private and public hospitals and clinics, medical store, laboratory to track your health related data, 
which the concern entity will enter in to the system. This will give on time information to health authority 
so that, action can be taken on right time and thus it can save many people from becoming a victim to
viral disease. We aim to gather only health related data, so we are not aiming to involve
any economical transaction in to the system. The main problem in today's date is we are not
having any centralize database of individual person, and because of that it is impossible to take
proper precaution for prevention of any viral disease.When we have this system, a doctor
can record every detail of the patient's case history for future reference. This card
is aiming to store all the health related information day to day data centrally which can
be analysed later to retrieve the health trends of different state, city and
area. Patient doesn't have any records of their past health history, which can be now stored
online so patient can access it anytime for reference. In any personal lifetime, he/she visits to
many different doctors and the doctor is unaware about the patient's past treatment history. But
now after this project everything is synchronized and well managed.
