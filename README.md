# Health-Card
Health Card that acts as an identity proof which manages our day to day health history like disease, allergy etc., It aims to store all the health related information day to day data centrally which can be analyzed by using certain mechanism to retrieve the health trends of different state, city and area.

We have aadhar card, Pan card, Voter id, Driving licence like identity proofs for our day to day
transactions, but we have major missing that is our health card, which manages our day to day
health history like disease, allergy etc. And same card is used everywhere in private and public
hospitals and clinics, medical store, laboratory to track your health related data, which the
concern entity will enter in to the system. This will give on time information to health authority so
that, action can be taken on right time and thus it can save many people to become victim of
some viral disease. We aim to gather only health related data, so we are not aiming to involve
any economical transaction in to the system. The main problem in today's date is we are not
having any centralize database of individual person, and because of that it is impossible to take
proper precaution for prevention of any viral disease. Next is when doctor give any prescription to
patient doctor do not have any record of that prescription. So next time if doctor wants to take
any past reference of same patient than it is not possible. So when we have this system, doctor
can record every minor details of every case of patient which can be refer any time. This
definition is aiming to store all the health related information day to day data centrally which can
be analysed by using certain mechanism to retrieve the health trends of different state, city and
area. Patient doesn't have any records of their past health history, which can be now stored
online so patient can access it anytime for reference. In any personal lifetime, he/she visits to
many different doctors and one doctor is unaware about another doctor's past treatment. But
now after this project everything is synchronized and well managed.
